# UNDERSTANDING FROM BAISCS

# New Environment: ??

What is it? An environment in programming is an isolated space where you can install packages and dependencies specific to your project. This avoids conflicts between different projects on your system that might require different versions of the same library.

Why do we use it? Using a virtual environment helps you to keep the dependencies required for your project separate from your global Python environment. This prevents version conflicts and ensures that your project will run the same on any machine.

# how to create venv
# Create a virtual environment named 'venv'

If the venv folder or Scripts/activate script is missing, you need to create the virtual environment:

# Make sure you're in your project directory --
cd /d/Projects/ML\ projects

# Create a virtual environment named 'venv' --
python -m venv venv
This will create the venv folder with all necessary subdirectories, including Scripts.

# Setting up Virtual Environments:
Command Prompt/PowerShell: .\venv\Scripts\activate
Git Bash: source ./venv/Scripts/activate

# Installing Dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Running Python Scripts:
python script_name.py

# Version Control with Git:
Common commands like git status, git add, git commit work in all interfaces.

Check Python Interpreter Path :
To verify that the virtual environment is active, run:
# Verify Active Environment with Python Command:
where python
It should show the path to the Python executable inside your venv directory,

# Verify pip Installation Path (Optional):
To ensure pip is also using the correct environment, you can run:
where pip
It should show a path similar to D:\Projects\ML projects\venv\Scripts\pip.exe

What Does This Mean?
Current State: When your virtual environment is activated, the first pip (D:\Projects\ML projects\venv\Scripts\pip.exe) should be the one in use, meaning all package installations and commands will be isolated to your project environment.
No Conflict: The Anaconda pip executable will not interfere as long as your virtual environment is activated.

# Verifying the Active pip Environment
You can further verify which pip is active by checking its version and location using the following commands:
pip --version

The output should look something like this:
pip 21.0.1 from D:\Projects\ML projects\venv\lib\site-packages\pip (python 3.8)
This indicates that pip is using the virtual environment’s site-packages directory.

# Why Use Virtual Environments in ML Projects?
Isolation of Dependencies:

Machine Learning (ML) projects often require specific versions of libraries (like TensorFlow, NumPy, Pandas, etc.) to ensure compatibility and reproducibility. Using a virtual environment isolates these dependencies from your system’s global Python environment, preventing version conflicts with other projects.
Reproducibility:

Virtual environments help in maintaining a consistent environment for your project. This means that someone else can clone your repository, set up the virtual environment using requirements.txt, and run the project without compatibility issues. This is crucial for ML projects where different projects might need different library versions.
Avoiding Conflicts:

ML libraries frequently receive updates, and some may not be backward-compatible. A virtual environment prevents conflicts between different projects that may need different versions of the same library.
Lightweight Environment:

Compared to the global environment, a virtual environment is lightweight, containing only the necessary packages for the specific proje


# create a new virtual environment for every new ML project ?
Yes, it is a best practice to create a new virtual environment for every new ML project. Here’s why you should do this and how to follow the process:

Why Create a New Virtual Environment for Each ML Project?
Dependency Management:

Each ML project may require different versions of libraries such as TensorFlow, Scikit-Learn, Pandas, etc. Creating a virtual environment ensures that these dependencies are isolated and specific to your project.

# why setup.py
setup.py: Making Your Project Installable
The setup.py file is a build script used by setuptools to package your project and make it installable. It can define your project metadata and its dependencies, 
in setup.py ---
find_packages(): This function automatically finds all packages and sub-packages in your project directory that contain an __init__.py file.
This file is mainly used to make your project easy to install and distribute. If someone wants to install your project, they can run:
pip install .
This command looks at the setup.py and installs your project along with the required libraries

# why requiremensts
requirements.txt: Managing Project Dependencies
The requirements.txt file is used to specify the external libraries and packages that your project depends on. This file allows you to install all necessary packages with a single command, ensuring that anyone who clones your project can set up the same environment.
-e .: This line tells Python to include your own project as a package in "editable mode," which means if you make changes to your code, you don’t need to reinstall your project. It's useful during development.
Without -e .:
Your project is not linked to the current directory.
Any changes you make to your source code will not be immediately reflected when you run the project.
If you want to use your project’s modules or packages, you will have to install your project as a regular package using pip install . every time you make a change

# why __init__.py kyun bnaya ?? 
_init__.py: Defining a Python Package
The __init__.py file is used to mark a directory as a Python package. It's necessary for Python to recognize the folder as a package and allows you to import modules from it.

Why Create __init__.py?
It allows you to structure your project in a way that supports modular code organization.
It makes it possible to use from src import mymodule rather than relying on file paths.

A file placed inside a folder to tell Python that this folder should be treated as a package (a collection of modules).

mlproject/
│
├── setup.py
├── requirements.txt
├── src/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── data_processing.py
│   └── model_training.py
With __init__.py in the src folder, you can now import your modules like this:
python
Copy code
from src.data_processing import clean_data
from src.model_training import train_model
How to use it?
Simply create an empty __init__.py file inside your folder. It can also contain code that should run when the package is imported, but usually, it's kept empty.
